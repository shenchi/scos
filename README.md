# scos

This is a simple operating system, which I wrote from scratch in my high school in order to learn how an OS runs on a machine. It mostly a mimic to the 0.11 version of Linux. And it contains a kernel, a shell and some tools that can run on it.
The kernel features:
*running on protected mode, 32-bit.
*(only) support flappy disk controller and FAT-12 system.
*multi-processing and each process has 64MB memory
*an API through software interruption
